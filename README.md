## hangzz

hangzz is a web application that uses saved addresses for both work & home, to pick the perfect spot for your next hangout!

A web application built using a Rails frontend and backend. It uses Google's directions API to calculate the average commute time added for members of a group. 

After creating an account, uesrs can join a group and create a hangout with the option to set the time and date wanted.

Through calculations from the backend, Google's Direction API was used to calculate every single members average added commute time from work --> potential meetup location --> home. After cycling through our list of restaurants, it presents the user 5 potential locations for their meetup, along with the average added commute time for the entire group.

friendlyID was also used to make sure our urls were human-readable.
